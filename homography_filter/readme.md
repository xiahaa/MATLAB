## continuous estimation of homography matrix using SL3 filter

1. with known group velocity (trivial);

### use homography matrix as measurement

2. unknown group velocity: but assume it is constant (done);

### use point correspondence as measurement

3. unknown group velocity: but assume it is constant (done);

4. unknow group velocity: assume the group undergoes rigid motion (not yet complemented);
