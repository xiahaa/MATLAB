In this folder, I tried to learn the famous Perspective N Point algorithm which aims to estimate transformation information from a batch (>=3) 3D-2D correspondence points.
For some algorithms, I re-implemented them, while for others, I just write a warpper to call them.

Already Imeplemented:
1. P3P Gao;
2. P3P Kneip;
3. P3P Pst;
4. PnP AK;
5. PnP QuanLong;
6. LHM;
7. EPnP (intermediate result differs with the EPnP, but final result approaches with numerical error);
8. POSIT;
